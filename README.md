# Koto Restoran — Web Site

**Live demo:** https://kotorestoran.vercel.app/#/  

## 🔎 What is this project

Koto Restoran is a static/SPA website for a restaurant.  
It showcases the menu, gallery, philosophy, contact info, and other sections — essentially a full restaurant landing site built with modern web technologies.

## 🚀 Why / Motivation

- I wanted to build a clean, modern, responsive website for a restaurant as a practice project.  
- To learn and apply good frontend architecture with a component-based approach, asset management (local images), SPA routing, and a modern tooling setup (Vite, React/TS, etc.).  
- To have a deployable, real-world-looking project that can serve as portfolio material.

## 🧰 Tech Stack  

- **Vite** — fast build tool and dev server  
- **React** / **TypeScript** — for UI components + type safety  
- (Add any other libraries you used — e.g. for styling, routing, state, etc.)  
- Local asset management — images loaded from project files
